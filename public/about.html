<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Glad you made it this far to check out my journey, I have been an inspiring web developer for over a year now, it's been quite the Journey learning
  what it means to become a Web Developer. Through this process I have hit many moments where I felt stuck or inadequate, but by powering through
and learning to appreciate this skill I have never discovered so much about my strengths and weakness as a PERSON!
I am now extremly grateful to be on this path know it has grown my skills, my profession and most importantantly my character.</p>

<p>Web Development taught me the importance to recognizing problems and solving them. It kind of created this universal rule in my 
  head which you can use in just about any fasset of life. "If this, then what?" So if I see a problem I go "If this problem caused this effect
  , then what can I do about it, or what has someone else done about it". Recognizing problems and asking questions is a always a big process in learning
  just about anything. I an deeply grateful not only to be able to potentially change my life around with this skill but for what's already been changed
  about myself by step into the world of programming a year ago.

<p>Aside from Web Developement I come from a very artstic and spiritual background, I grew up being really into the modern music scene. 
  Until I graduated High School I thought I'd be in some band like "Walk-The-Moon" or "21 Pilots" but after life decisions and trying out 
  college I soon realized that it was not the route for me. I then begin to struggle over years in regards what I wanted to do, I had dropped
  out of college, I was no longer playing music, and I was in a toxic spiritual enviroment so then I left the church. It wasn't until 
  I begin my journey in Web Developement did I truly discover what I want to do. Discovery one's self isn't easy but it's the most rewarding thing.
  So my friends, if you're reading this, my message here to you is, "Know thy self, love thy self, and honor thy self".
